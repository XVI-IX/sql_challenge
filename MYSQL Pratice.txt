1. Provide the list of markets in which customer "Atliq Exclusive" operates its
   business in the APAC region.
   
   Query:
   SELECT DISTINCT(markets)
   FROM gdb023.dim_customer
   WHERE customer = 'Atliq Exclusive'
   AND region = 'APAC';
   
2. What is the percentage of unique product increase in 2021 vs. 2020?
	 
	 Query:
	
	 --step 1:
		 WITH count_2020 AS (
		 SELECT count(distinct(product_code)) as count_2020, fiscal_year
		 from fact_sales_monthly
		 where fiscal_year = '2020'),
		 count_2021 AS (
		 SELECT count(distinct(product_code)) as count_2021, fiscal_year
		 from fact_sales_monthly
		 where fiscal_year = '2021')
	
	 -- Step 2:
			SELECT a.count_2020 as unique_products_2020,
			b.count_2021 as unique_products_2021, 
			(((b.count_2021 - a.count_2020) / a.count_2020) * 100) as percentage_chg
			FROM count_2020 as a
			cross join count_2021 as b;
			
3.  Provide a report with all the unique product counts for each segment and
	  sort them in descending order of product counts.
	  
	  Query:
	  
	  --step 1:
	  	 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(product_code)) as product_code, segment
 			 FROM dim_product 
 			 GROUP BY segment
 			 ORDER BY 1 DESC;
	  
4.	Follow-up: Which segment had the most increase in unique products in
		2021 vs 2020?
	  
		Query:
		WITH count_2020 AS (
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(a.product_code)) as product_2020,
		a.segment as segment
		FROM dim_product as a
		LEFT JOIN fact_sales_monthly as b
		ON a.product_code = b.product_code
		WHERE b.fiscal_year = '2020'
		GROUP BY segment
		ORDER BY 1 DESC),
		count_2021 AS(
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(a.product_code)) as product_2021,
		a.segment as segment
		FROM dim_product as a
		LEFT JOIN fact_sales_monthly as b
		ON a.product_code = b.product_code
		WHERE b.fiscal_year = '2021'
		GROUP BY a.segment
		ORDER BY 1 DESC)

		SELECT DISTINCT(a.segment), a.product_2020, b.product_2021
		FROM count_2020 as a
		JOIN count_2021 as b;

5.	Get the products that have the highest and lowest manufacturing costs.

		Query:

		--Step 1: highest manufacturing costs
				SELECT dim_product.product_code, product, manufacturing_cost
				FROM  dim_product
				INNER JOIN fact_manufacturing_cost
				ON 
				dim_product.product_code = fact_manufacturing_cost.product_code
				ORDER BY manufacturing_cost DESC
				LIMIT 1;

		--Step 2: lowest manufacturing costs
				SELECT dim_product.product_code, product, manufacturing_cost
				FROM  dim_product
				INNER JOIN fact_manufacturing_cost
				ON 
				dim_product.product_code = fact_manufacturing_cost.product_code
				ORDER BY manufacturing_cost
				LIMIT 1;
